# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Louies using excel to find out if there are specific factors that determine the success of a project campaign.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As shown in the image above,overall speaking, the percentage of reaching the goal is higher than the percentage of failure to reaching the goal through out the year. However, among all the months during th year, we can see that May has the highest rate of successful outcome, June has the second highest rate and July comes after. Forth qurter has the lowest percentage of reaching the goals through out the year.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

As for outcomes based on goals, we can see success of fund raising also has relationship with the amount of the goal. The image above shows that range of 45,000 to 49,999 has the highest percentage of success and lowest percentage of failure through out all the goals.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This is a very interesting project, as it did help me understand more about the functions in Excel and how to use them properly. When working on the Outcome Base on Goal section, I spend a lot of time on entering the fomula in each cell and it is very important to pay attention to each condition entered in the formula.
## Results

In conclusion, one of the factors that brings success to a project campaign is time. As the result shown above, in order to be successful in reaching the goal of fund raising, it is recommanded that Louies start her fund raising during the middle of the year. And also, another factor that brinds success to a project campaign is the amount that is going to be funded. According to our result, we can come up with a conclusion that when the goal falls between 45,000 and 49,999, it is more possible to reach the goal.

Even though we have gotten a lot of data regarding this campaign, we can still have more data to make the analysis more reliable. For example, as we focus on data of theaters, we can also know the what tpye are they of each play. From there, we will be able to know what kind of plays has more posibility of reaching the goal of fund raising. And with these data available, we will be able to come up with a pivot table showing the amount of fund raised for each type of play and the percentage of success for each type of play.
